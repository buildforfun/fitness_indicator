1. What problem is this solving?
---------------------------------------
People are terrible judge of their own fitness and one possible reason for this is that our fitness can be a hidden metric. It's hard to judge how healthy you are compared to others in your age group.

2. What am I building?
---------------------------------------
I'm building a tool that allows users to refer to a single fitness score based on general fitness metrics.

3. Why the market is interesting?
---------------------------------------
People are interested in their body more than ever, there are more and more health youtube channels and the whole fitness wearable market proves this.
